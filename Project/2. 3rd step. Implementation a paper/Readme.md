# EDA: Easy Data Augmentation Techniques for Boosting Performance on Text Classification Tasks

This repository contains the implementation of **EDA (Easy Data Augmentation)** techniques for improving the performance of text classification models. The EDA techniques include synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, and random deletion, designed to enhance the diversity of training data and improve model generalization.

## **Overview**
EDA is a simple yet effective set of techniques that help boost text classification performance by generating augmented training data. These techniques are particularly useful for handling small datasets and improving model robustness.

## **Source and Citation**
The core implementation in this repository is adapted from the original repository by Jason Wei and Kai Zou:
